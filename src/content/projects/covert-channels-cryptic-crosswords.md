## Problem
Could an adversary hide and exchange information through seemingly ordinary cryptic crossword constructions?

## Approach
- Modeled multiple data-hiding channels anchored to clue and grid constraints.
- Studied how linguistic ambiguity and puzzle conventions can carry covert signals.
- Evaluated feasibility in realistic communication settings.

## Key Result
The study showed practical hiding opportunities in puzzle artifacts that appear benign to normal readers.

## Publication
