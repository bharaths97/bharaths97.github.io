# Tiered Memory Architecture (Isolated Track)

Branch: `tiered-memory-architecture`

This folder is the isolated documentation track for tiered-memory experimentation and performance evaluation.

## Structure
- `input/`
  - source requirement/research guides
- `spec/`
  - technical architecture + implementation mapping
- `plan/`
  - phased execution and checkpoints
  - security test plan and gates

## Scope Boundary
- This track does not modify the existing `docs/` folder.
- Existing chat/admin production-hardening work is considered frozen until this track is complete.

## Source Inputs Used
- `tiered_memory_docs/input/tiered_memory_architecture_guide.md`
- `tiered_memory_docs/input/memory_system_codebase_prompt.md`

Note: `tiered_momory_architecture_guide.md` (typo variant) was not present.
